# Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind) - Harsh Mishra (Template)

This is a Next.js (app router) + TailwindCSS portfolio template pre-filled with data from your resume.

## What is included
- Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Certificates, Contact sections
- TailwindCSS config and PostCSS
- A placeholder profile SVG (`/public/profile.svg`)

## Quick start (step-by-step)

1. **Download & extract** the ZIP you received.
2. **Open in VS Code**
   - Launch VS Code → `File` → `Open Folder...` → select the extracted `portfolio-next` folder.
   - Or open a terminal and run `code /path/to/portfolio-next` (if `code` CLI is installed).
3. **Install dependencies**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (View → Terminal) and run:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
4. **Run the dev server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
5. **Edit content**
   - All text is in `app/components/*.jsx`. Replace strings (name, links, project descriptions) as needed.
   - Replace `/public/profile.svg` with your own image (keep filename or update the path in `Hero.jsx`).
